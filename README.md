# learning-about-version-control
“Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!”

Learning more about version control has made me more confident in my ability to work collaboratively on projects, and has given me the opportunity to become more familiar with the basics of my operating system. 

Working within the terminal sometimes feels like being at the center of a web - when something is not working as expected, I find it difficult to determine where the problem is and how far out it extends. The terminal interface is not very interpretable, and I am still getting used to it.

Practicing for midterm.
